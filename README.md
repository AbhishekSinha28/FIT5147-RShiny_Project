# FIT5147-RShiny_Project
This repository contains my work on Victorian Crime Data using R Markdown and R shiny as part of FIT5147 (Data Visualization) unit.
The Shiny app is created using the Five Design-Sheet (FDS) Methodology. The Five Design-Sheet (FDS) Methodology was introduced as a way of formalising sketching and lo-fidelity prototyping to allow visualisation designers explore their ideas without worrying on the technical aspects.
The Data Visualisation Report gives a walkthrough on how I used this process to reach to the final sketch of my Shiny App.
A detailed description on how to use the Shiny web app is also present in the Data Visualisation Report.
